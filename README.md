## Requirements

+ [B2BinPay](https://b2binpay.com) account
+ PHP >= 7.0
+ PHP extensions enabled: cURL, JSON

## Composer Installation

The easiest way to install the B2BinPay API client is to require it with [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) through command-line:
```
    $ composer require noname9/api-php
```
or by editing `composer.json`:
```
    {
        "require": {
            "noname9/api-php": "^1.0"
        }
    }
```

## Getting started

See example code with comments in [public/index.php](public/index.php)

### Create Provider instance

Use the API key and secret to access your B2BinPay account:

```php
$provider = new B2Binpay\Provider(
    'API_KEY',
    'API_SECRET'
);
``` 

#### Test Mode

In order to use testing sandbox, pass `true` as a third parameter for `B2Binpay\Provider`:

```php
$provider = new B2Binpay\Provider(
    'API_KEY',
    'API_SECRET',
    true
);
``` 

**Warning:** Sandbox and main gateway have their own pairs of key and secret!

### Create a bill

_The payment currency is considered to match the currency of your wallet_.

Create a new bill:

```php
$bill = $provider->createBill(
    WALLET_ID,
    '0.00000001',
    'BTC',
    LIFETIME
);
```
_where `LIFETIME` - number of seconds for payment page to live and `WALLET_ID` - your B2BinPay wallet id._

Now the bill id is available in the `$bill->id` property. You should store this id with your order.

After storing the bill id you can find an url to the payment page in the `$bill->url` property.  

Finally, you can check bill status by requesting it using the stored id:

```php
$billCheck = $provider->getBill($bill->id);
```

The bill status will be stored in `$billCheck->status` property.

### Convert currency

You can get actual rates and convert supported currencies respecting your wallet's parameters.

Get rates for _USD_:

```php
$rates = $provider->getRates('USD');
```

Convert currency using actual rates:

```php
$amount = $provider->convertCurrency('100', 'USD', 'BTC', $rates);
```

Now you can provide `$amount` variable as a second parameter for `createBill()` method to set an accurate amount of cryptocurrency.

### Add markup

You can add some markup to the existing amount.

Set _10%_ markup for current amount:

```php
$amount = $provider->addMarkup($amount, 'BTC', 10);
```

### Get your wallet's params

You can retrieve your wallet's params to find out actual currency and current amount:

```php
$wallet = $provider->getWallet(WALLET_ID);
```

Now your wallet's currency alpha code is stored in the `$wallet->currency->alpha` parameter.

You can use it for `createBill()`, `addMarkup()` and `convertCurrency()` methods.

### Callback

Once bill status changed, our server can send a callback to your configured Callback URL. Also, you can specify Tracking ID, which will return with the callback to identify the exact order.
To do that provide additional parameters to `createBill()` method:

```php
$bill = $provider->createBill(
    WALLET_ID,
    '0.00000001',
    'BTC',
    LIFETIME,
    TRACKING_ID,
    'https://my.callback.url/'
);
```

**Warning:** If specified, your Callback URL should return the message "OK" with status 200. Until that payment will not be considered complete!

```php
header('HTTP/1.1 200 OK');
exit('OK');
```

#### Callback verification

You can verify Callback request headers by comparing it with the `getAuthorization()` method output:

```php
if (empty($headers['Authorization']) || ($headers['Authorization'] !== $provider->getAuthorization())) {
    header('HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized');
    exit();
}
```

#### Callback body

Callback request will contain the following data:

```
{
    "data": {
        "id": ID,
        "url": URL_TO_BILL_PAGE,
        "address": BLOCKCHAIN_ADDRESS,
        "created": TIME,
        "expired": TIME|NULL,
        "status": BILL_STATUS,
        "tracking_id": TRACKING_ID,
        "amount": AMOUNT_MULTIPLIED_BY_TEN_IN_POW,
        "actual_amount": ALREADY_PAID_AMOUNT_MULTIPLIED_BY_TEN_IN_POW,
        "pow": POW,
        "message": MESSAGE
    }
}
```
